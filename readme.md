## üí° Overview
**Brain Pulse** is a graduation project from Misr Engineering and Technology Academy (MET) that bridges the gap between complex neurological diagnostics and accessibility. The project features an integrated system combining a custom-designed EEG Helmet, a user-friendly mobile application, and a powerful AI backend.

This repository provides a deep dive into the technical architecture of the project, with a special focus on the core innovation: **a Deep Learning model for the automated classification of EEG signals**.

## ‚ùó The Problem
Interpreting EEG data is a time-consuming process that requires highly specialized neurologists. This creates significant challenges, especially in resource-constrained environments.

- **High Misdiagnosis Rate:** Approximately **30%** of epilepsy cases are initially misdiagnosed or missed entirely, leading to incorrect treatment or none at all.
- **Lack of Access:** In regions like Egypt, over **80%** of patients, particularly in rural and underserved areas, lack proper access to timely diagnosis and treatment.
- **Inefficient Analysis:** Standard EEG recordings detect less than **40%** of actual seizure activity, and manual interpretation can take 30-60 minutes per patient, creating a bottleneck in clinical workflows.

## ‚ú® Our Solution
Our solution is a complete, end-to-end system designed to empower clinicians. It integrates custom hardware, a cross-platform mobile app, and a robust AI backend to provide a seamless, accurate, and real-time tool for detecting brain abnormalities anytime, anywhere.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware
The foundation of our system is a custom-designed, low-cost, and portable EEG Helmet. The hardware was engineered to be both effective and accessible.
- **Custom 3D-Printed Helmet:** A flexible and comfortable helmet designed in SOLIDWORKS and printed with PLA/TPU material. It includes 20 electrode sockets and internal wire channels for organized and safe routing.
- **16-Channel Data Acquisition:** Utilizes 19 golden-plated cup electrodes (16 active, 1 reference, 1 ground) to capture real-time EEG data.
- **Analog Front-End:** A multi-stage signal conditioning circuit featuring signal amplification (AD620, OP07), and advanced filtering (DRL, Notch, Low-Pass) to ensure a clean, high-quality signal.
- **Digital Conversion & Transmission:** An ESP32 microcontroller handles Analog-to-Digital Conversion and transmits the EEG data packets via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the mobile application.

## üì± Mobile Application
The mobile application serves as the user-friendly interface for doctors, allowing them to manage patients and interact with the AI model's predictions.
- **Built with Flutter:** For a single, high-performance codebase that runs natively on both Android and iOS.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Ensures a clean, scalable, and maintainable code structure.
- **Core Features for Doctors:**
  - **Patient Management:** Add, view, and manage patient records and diagnostic history.
  - **Live EEG Monitoring:** Connect to the EEG headset and visualize brainwave data in real time.
  - **AI-Powered Diagnosis:** Upload EEG data (or connect live) to get instant classification from the AI backend.
  - **Data Visualization:** Presents the AI model's probability scores for each class in an intuitive and clear interface.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Backend
The backend is the central nervous system of our project, responsible for handling data, authenticating users, and running the AI model.
- **Technology Stack:** Built with **.NET 8 (ASP.NET Core Web API)** and C#, ensuring a robust, high-performance, and scalable system.
- **REST API:** Provides a secure and efficient communication layer between the mobile app and the server.
- **AI Model Integration:** Utilizes the **ONNX Runtime** to directly load and run our pre-trained PyTorch model within the C# environment. This allows for fast, low-latency inference without needing a separate Python server.
- **Secure & Scalable:** Implements JWT for secure doctor authentication and uses Entity Framework Core with a Microsoft SQL Server database for reliable data management.

## üß† AI
Our end-to-end AI pipeline transforms raw brainwave signals into actionable clinical insights. The process is designed to be efficient, robust, and interpretable.

### 1. Data Source & Preprocessing
The model was trained on the **"HMS - Harmful Brain Activity Classification"** dataset from Kaggle. Our unique preprocessing pipeline is the first key step:
- **Raw EEG to Spectrogram:** We convert 10-minute raw EEG segments into spectrograms‚Äîvisual representations of the signal's frequency content over time. This allows our CNN to "see" patterns in the brainwaves.
- **Normalization & Cleaning:** We normalize the data to ensure consistency and handle any missing values to make the model robust.
- **4-Channel Image Generation:** The core of our feature engineering. The full spectrogram is intelligently split and stacked to create a **4-channel image `(4, 300, 100)`**, where each channel represents a key brain region montage (Left Lateral, Right Lateral, Left Parasagittal, Right Parasagittal). This allows the model to learn spatial and location-based patterns critical for neurological diagnosis.

### 2. Model Architecture
We designed a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in PyTorch, specifically tailored for our 4-channel spectrogram images. The architecture follows a classic funnel structure:
- **Input Stage:** Takes the `4x300x100` image.
- **Feature Spotters (Convolutional Layers):** Multiple blocks of `Conv2D`, `BatchNorm`, `ReLU`, and `MaxPool` layers scan the image to detect low-level features and build up to more complex patterns unique to each EEG class.
- **Simplifiers (Pooling Layers):** Max-pooling layers reduce dimensionality and create a summarized feature map, making the model more efficient.
- **Decision Maker (Classifier):** A `Flatten` layer followed by `Dense` (Linear) layers classifies the features into one of six output categories.


### 3. Training & Validation
- **Framework:** PyTorch
- **Optimizer:** Adam Optimizer (`lr=1e-3`)
- **Loss Function:** Cross-Entropy Loss
- **Performance:** Achieved a **validation accuracy of 91.36%** after 12 epochs.

### 4. Model Performance
To understand performance in detail, we analyzed predictions using confusion matrices.

**Normalized Confusion Matrix:** Shows high accuracy across all categories, with strong performance on `GPD`, `GRDA`, and `Seizure`.

**Misclassification Matrix:** Highlights only the model's errors, revealing which classes are most often confused. This is crucial for understanding the model's limitations and areas for future improvement.
